***this slide is probably going to be deleted***

For the sake of our audience, we thought it necessary to explicitly state the intentions behind this presentation and the expected outcomes:
- We anticipate that individual review of this slide deck will serve as a more informative experience to the audience than the initial presentation.  
- In this light, we made it our primary goal that each slide be self-explanatory, and cite where that information came from.
- As a consequence, much of our spoken presentation will be more about our personal extrapolations of that content. 
- Naturally, this means we invite the audience to ask questions freely, and to engage in discussion on the subjects covered.
